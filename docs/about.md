Hi 👋🏽, my name is Shiveen and I'm a software engineer based out of Sydney, Australia. I like talking about all things tech and trying out new burger spots all around the world. I was first introduced to tech and electronics when I was around 8 years old in the form of a crusty old compaq (remember those, or maybe not). I spent most of my weekends tinkering with electronics and as I grew up, became fascinated with playing with old electronic equipment in the house and soldering old 8086s together and running silly assembly scripts.

Aside from programming and burgers. I'm also an avid hiker/camper and love to get out in the nature every once in a while. I'm hoping to start documenting my landscape shots here soon...
