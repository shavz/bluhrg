Hi! I'm Shiveen Pandita 👋🏽 🤓

I like building software and products for companies that are making a difference. I have previously worked in finance at [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) and lead the platform team for a large scale orders and payments system @ [Ordermentum](https://www.ordermentum.com/). Currently working on making the retirement lives of average australian better by making [superannuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia) efficient @ [Grow Super](https://www.growsuper.com/).

Growing up, I've always been fascinated with how the world works and the ability to write software as living allows me explore all the creative possibilities I can think of to make someone's life better. More on my reading [here](/reading).

In my spare time I love catching up on all things astronomy 🌌 🚀 and am an avid reader with my favourite genres being hard science fiction, psychology and autobiographical novels.

I also am passionate about camping 🏕 hiking 🥾 and sometimes landscape photography ⛰ 📷  - and always try to find time in schedule to swicth off a connect with nature.

Here's what I sometimes look like:
