Hi I'm Shiveen Pandita 👋🏽 

![](about_me.jpg)

I like building software and products for companies that are making a difference. I have previously worked in finance and lead the platform team for a large scale orders and payments platform. Currently working on making the retirement lives of average australian better by making super efficient at [Grow Super](https://www.growsuper.com/).

I'm into camping 🏕 hiking 🥾 and landscape photography ⛰ 📷 and always try to find time in my schedule to switch off and spend time away from the screen. 

Growing up, I've always been fascinated with how the world works and the ability to write software as living allows me explore all the possibilities I can think of and also connect them with what I learn when I go out in the Nature.
