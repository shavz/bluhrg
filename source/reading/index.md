- [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens)

    A fairly popular book, recommended by a few of my friends by the time I got around to reading it. Thoroughly enjoyed it and Yuval has an uncanny ability to make the most boring history lessons sound like going on an adventure. A word of advice on the title however, I went into it think it was a history book, but it's more of a discourse on human sociology and inherent biological and environmental changes that shaped it through the years.

- [The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36500398-the-order-of-time?from_choice=false&from_home_module=false&rating=3)

    Although started a bit slow, and I think I expected it to be some kind of revelations book but having done both quantum physics and some post university level physics - I was slightly disappointed since it seemed like it was just an explain like I'm 5 version of higher order physics. However, the prose was very enjoyable and it was good to finally understand some more obscure concepts in a lot more detail thanks to the writing prowess of the author.

- [The Spin by Robert Charles Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin)
  
  Thoroughly enjoyed this book - had an interesting take on what it means to be a sentient species in the grand scheme of the universe.

- [Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications)

  I'm not usually a fan of big technical tomes, but this was a very informative and good read. The key takeaway wasn't any new concepts, though there were a few of those, but they way it was presented and the absolutely perfect writing and research.
