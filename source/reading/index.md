  Thoroughly enjoyed this book - had an interesting take on what it means to be a sentient species in the grand scheme of the universe.

- [Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications)

  I'm not usually a fan of big technical tomes, but this was a very informative and good read. The key takeaway wasn't any new concepts, though there were a few of those, but they way it was presented and the absolutely perfect writing and research.
