## Blog

This is my personal blog where I document the things that amuse (or sometimes confuse) me. 

The blog is generated using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) and is deployed on Netlify.

### To run the site locally

- Install VuePress: `npm install -g vuepress@next` or `yarn global add vuepress@next`

- Build static files: `vuepress build`

- Run the dev server for blog docs: `vuepress dev docs`
